I'm a seasoned technical documentarian, armed with the power to turn bewildering tech speak into plain English gold. I specialise in cracking the code of complex software and processes, whipping up documentation that's so clear it shines. 

Need someone to demystify your enterprise software? 
Bring order to a seething mass of desolate knowledge base topics? 
Deliver delight in your UI? 

Creating order in content chaos sparks my joy! âœ¨


I'm experienced in creating technical content for cloud-based enterprise software applications in a variety of industries.

I specialise in creating plain-language, task-oriented, user-focused process content to support and improve client engagement. I collaborate with product and delivery teams to research, plan and deliver content needs. I also work with support and client-facing teams to identify gaps in user knowledge.

Content types I have produced include in-product and online help, user guides, administration and configuration guides, release notes, API documents and in-product user interface (UI) text.
