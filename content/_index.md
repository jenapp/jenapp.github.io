I am a seasoned documentarian with experience creating technical content for cloud-based enterprise software applications in a variety of industries.

I specialise in creating plain-language, task-oriented, user-focused process content to support and improve client engagement. Content types I have produced include in-product and online help, user guides, administration and configuration guides, release notes, API documents and in-product user interface (UI) text.

I collaborate with product and delivery teams to research, plan and deliver content needs. I also work with support and client-facing teams to identify gaps in user knowledge.
