### Context

Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation. They welcome everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.

Write the Docs connects the docs community through:
- a Slack network
- local in-person and online meetups
- in-person and online conferences around the world

### Contribution

Write the Docs Australia holds an annual conference that facilitates networking, education and community building among content professionals.

I've now been part of the planning team for multiple Australian conferences. As well as general planning, I've contributed to:
- venue selection
- sourcing catering quotes, ordering and wrangling catering delivery
- proposal review and speaker selection
- set up, clean up and pack down on conference days
