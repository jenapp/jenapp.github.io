### Context

As a Technical Writer with Inomial my role was to collaborate with the engineering and customer success teams to document the Smile product for our clients. As the Inomial user doc set grew a central document portal was required to replace a limited WordPress site.

The [docs.inomial.com](https://docs.inomial.com/) site provided access to all:
- product user and reference guides
- public schema
- import/export formats
- product brochures

### Action

**Oxygen Author** was used to author all Smile guides, quick reference guides and format guides.

The portal was published using **Netlify**.

The most significant guides that I authored in this doc set are the:
- [Smile User Guide](https://docs.inomial.com/pdf/SmileGuides/Smile_User_60_V2.1.pdf)
- [Smile Configuration Guide](https://docs.inomial.com/pdf/SmileGuides/Smile_Config_60_V1.3.compressed.pdf)
- [Smile Developer Guide](https://docs.inomial.com/pdf/SmileGuides/Smile_Dev_60_V3.10.pdf)

### Result

- Central portal that contained all Inomial product guides and supporting material
- Guides available in multiple formats (PDF and HTML)
- Downloadable CSV format templates
