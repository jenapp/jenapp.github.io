### Context

I maintained multiple help systems during my time at Iress. On of these was in-product help for their [CommPay](https://www.iress.com/software/financial-advice/commpay/) product, an application for automating financial revenue management.

### Action

In addition to ongoing help updates for feature additions or other product changes, I used analytics (**Google Analytics** and **Heap**) to understand how help topics were being accessed and identify where content itself or structure could be improved. 

Topics related to the Suspense function were identified as some of the most commonly accessed content. Product managers and designers also provided feedback on what could be improved for these topics.

As part of this review, I:
- mapped the current help topics to the product interface to better understand the structure and flow of Suspense tasks
- reviewed and validated all topics to ensure they were up-to-date and complete

Content was drafted in **Google Docs** and published using **MadCap Flare**.

### Result

- Up-to-date topic content
- A more organised section structure
- Section structure that was more related to user workflow
