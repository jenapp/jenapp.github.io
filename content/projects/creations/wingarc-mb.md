### Context

My first project for WingArc Australia was to create an English language user guide of a business intelligence dashboard platform. This product was developed by the parent company, WingArc 1st, located in Japan.

The existing Japanese machine-translated documentation was not of an acceptable quality to provide to local Australian users.

### Action

Authored over 2000 pages in **Atlassian Confluence** and published using **Scroll Viewport** to apply custom CSS and manage versioning.

As part of the process, I:
- restructured content sections
- validated all processes
- created English version screenshots

### Result

- A locally maintained doc set, containing relevant examples and screenshots
