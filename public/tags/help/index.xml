      <description>Context I maintained multiple help systems during my time at Iress. On of these was in-product help for their CommPay product, an application for automating financial revenue management.&#xA;Action In addition to ongoing help updates for feature additions or other product changes, I used analytics (Google Analytics and Heap) to understand how help topics were being accessed and identify where content itself or structure could be improved.&#xA;Topics related to the Suspense function were identified as some of the most commonly accessed content.</description>

      <description>Context My first project for WingArc Australia was to create an English language user guide of a business intelligence dashboard platform. This product was developed by the parent company, WingArc 1st, located in Japan.&#xA;The existing Japanese machine-translated documentation was not of an acceptable quality to provide to local Australian users.&#xA;Action Authored over 2000 pages in Atlassian Confluence and published using Scroll Viewport to apply custom CSS and manage versioning.</description>
