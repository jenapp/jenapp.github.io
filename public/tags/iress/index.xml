      <description>Context I maintained multiple help systems during my time at Iress. On of these was in-product help for their CommPay product, an application for automating financial revenue management.&#xA;Action In addition to ongoing help updates for feature additions or other product changes, I used analytics (Google Analytics and Heap) to understand how help topics were being accessed and identify where content itself or structure could be improved.&#xA;Topics related to the Suspense function were identified as some of the most commonly accessed content.</description>
